# SortingVizualizer
This project is a sorting visualizer implemented in C++ using the SDL2 library. It provides a visual representation of various sorting algorithms to help users understand how different algorithms work. The visualizer covers the following sorting algorithms:

Selection Sort
Insertion Sort
Bubble Sort
Merge Sort
Quick Sort
Heap Sort
The visualization uses a fixed list size of 130 elements. Users can randomize the list and select any of the provided sorting algorithms to see how they sort the list in ascending order. Note that the visualization might not perfectly reflect the actual time complexities of the algorithms; faster algorithms like Merge Sort may be deliberately slowed down to enhance visual clarity.
